This project is a Question-Answering (QA) system built using LangChain, Google Generative AI, FAISS, and other related libraries. The system loads a PDF document, processes the text, and then creates a vector database for efficient text retrieval. It utilizes Google Generative AI to answer user queries based on the content of the loaded document. If the answer to a question is not found within the document, the system politely informs the user.
